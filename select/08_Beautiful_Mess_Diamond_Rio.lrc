[00:15.02] Going out of my mind these days
[00:20.23] Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
[00:23.64] I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
[00:28.94] And I need to shave
[00:38.44] 
[00:31.01] I go to work and I look tired
[00:36.16] The boss man said, "Son, you're gonna get fired
[00:40.09] This ain't your style"
[00:42.66] And behind my coffee cup, I just smiled
[01:02.16] 
[00:49.29] What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[00:53.77] Spending all of my time with you
[00:57.06] There's nothing else I'd rather do
[01:00.18] What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
[01:04.94] 'Cause I can't get enough, can't stop the hunger for your love
[01:11.12] What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[01:15.02] Ah, ah
[01:17.79] Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:24.79] 
[01:24.67] This morning put salt in my coffee
[01:30.54] I put my shoes on the wrong feet
[01:33.66] I'm losing my mind I swear
[01:37.05] It might be the death of me, but I don't care
[01:59.55] 
[01:43.64] What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[01:47.70] Spending all of my time with you
[01:51.06] There's nothing else I'd rather do
[01:54.21] What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
[01:59.27] 'Cause I can't get enough, can't stop the hunger for your love
[02:05.13] What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[02:09.49] Ah, ah
[02:12.02] Ah, ah, ah, ah
[02:19.02] 
[02:16.04] Is it your eyes, is it your smile?
[02:21.82] All I know is that you're driving me wild
[02:42.32] 
[02:27.01] What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[02:31.26] Spending all of my time with you
[02:34.36] There's nothing else I'd rather do
[02:37.55] What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
[02:42.51] 'Cause I can't get enough, can't stop the hunger for your love
[02:48.57] (What a beautiful, what a beautiful)
[03:06.57] 
[02:51.22] What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[02:55.79] Spending all of my time with you
[02:58.73] There's nothing else I'd rather do
[03:02.02] What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
[03:06.97] 'Cause I can't get enough, can't stop the hunger for your love
[03:13.19] What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
[03:36.19] 
[03:17.00] Ah, ah, ah
[03:19.82] Ah, ah, ah, ah
[03:25.43] Ah, ah, ah, ah
[03:30.53] Ah, ah, ah

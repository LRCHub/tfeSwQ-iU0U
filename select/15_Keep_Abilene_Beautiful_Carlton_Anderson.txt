Woke up at midnight, couldn't sleep
There lays a twenty-four hour smile
Making promises it'd never keep
Texas is so flat, had to see
If the world was round
Girl, you got roots 'neath your boots
That go a hundred years down

On my radio, Conway's singing "Goodbye Time"
In my rearview, a disappearing Hollywood sign

Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
There ain't nothing like you anywhere
Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
I'm getting there
I'm getting there

These wheels got at least
Another thousand miles to go
For a taste, your red wine kisses ain't
Slow-dancing to the stereo
I've seen the city lights
Felt the California sand
But it ain't nothing like
Getting back to you
From where I am

Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
There ain't nothing like you anywhere
Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
I'm getting there
I'm getting there
Ooh, ooh
Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
Keep Abilene beautiful

Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
There ain't nothing like you anywhere
Keep Abilene beautiful, baby
I'm getting there
I'm getting there

Woke up at midnight, couldn't sleep
There lays a twenty-four hour smile
Making promises it'd never keep
